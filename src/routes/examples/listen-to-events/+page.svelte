<h2>Listening to emitted events</h2>

<p>Here is the list of events that are emitted from splitpanes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ready has no parameter and fires when splitpanes is ready</li>
  <li>
    resize fires while resizing (on mousemove/touchmove) and returns an array of all the panes
    objects with their dimensions
  </li>
  <li>
    resized fires once when the resizing stops after user drag (on mouseup/touchend). it returns an
    array of all the panes objects with their dimensions. The event also fires after adding or
    removing a pane.
  </li>
  <li>pane-click returns the clicked pane object with its dimensions.</li>
  <li>pane-maximize returns the maximized pane object with its dimensions.</li>
  <li>
    pane-add returns an object containing the index of the added pane and the new array of panes
    after resize.
  </li>
  <li>
    pane-remove returns an object containing the removed pane and an array of all the remaining
    panes objects with their dimensions after resize.
  </li>
  <li>
    splitter-click returns the next pane object (with its dimensions) directly after the clicked
    splitter. This event is only emitted if dragging did not occur between mousedown and mouseup.
  </li>
</ul>
